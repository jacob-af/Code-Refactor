# Horiseon website refactor


This is a refactor of the Horiseon website with improved accessibility, semantic elements, consolidated CSS, and proper commenting.

You will find an **index.html** file, a folder named **assets** which contains two more folders: *css* and *images*, containing the necessary CSS and Images, respectively.

### Enjoy
