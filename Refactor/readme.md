# Horiseon website refactor

You will find an **index.html** file, a folder named **assets** which contains two more folders: *css* and *images*, containing the necessary CSS and Images, respectively.

## About the changes:
The refactor of this page included consolidating redundant css tags, changing <div>s with classes into appropriate semantic elements, adding alternate text tags to images, fixing links, and properly organizing the CSS file.  In the footer, aria-label text was added to compensate for symbols used.

### Enjoy
